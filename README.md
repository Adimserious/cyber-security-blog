## Agile methodology project Management with Github 
CyberSecurity Mindset adopted the Agile methodology project Management with GitHub using GitHub's features which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. Here's a comprehensive explanation of some of the features i used for the Cybersecurity Mindset blog to manage an agile project using GitHub:

### 1. Repositories

- Central Hub: Each project is stored in a GitHub repository, serving as the central hub for all project-related code, documentation, and resources.
- Version Control: GitHub provides version control, allowing teams to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate efficiently on code.

### 2. Issues and story points allocation

- Task Tracking:  Issues in GitHub were used to track tasks, bugs, enhancements, and user stories. Each issue represents a piece of work that needs to be completed.
- Labels: labels are used to categorize issues by type (e.g., must have, could have, should have), priority, status (e.g., in-progress, done), and sprint.
- Assignees: Assign issues to team members to designate responsibility, in this project, it was only myself.

### 3. MoSCoW Prioritization 

1. Must have (M): These are critical requirements or tasks that are essential for the success of the project. Without these, the project would fail or be significantly compromised.

2. Should have (S): Important requirements or tasks that are not critical but have a high value. They are not absolutely necessary for the current project phase but should be included if possible.

3. Could have (C): Desirable requirements or tasks that would be beneficial if included but are not necessary. They can be deferred or dropped if time or resources are limited.

4. Won't have (W): These are the least critical requirements or tasks that will not be included in the current project phase but might be considered for future phases.

### 4. Project Boards 

- Kanban Boards: GitHub Projects provide kanban-style boards where issues can be organized into columns such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. This visualizes the workflow and progress of tasks.

### 5. Milestones

- Sprint Planning: milestones were used to represent sprints or releases. Each milestone had a due date and a collection of issues that need to be completed within the sprint even though there was room for adjustment, not fixed or sequencial.
- Progress Tracking: The progress of milestones were tracked by monitoring the number of completed issues versus the total number of issues.

- README: Each repository typically has a README file that provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and other important information.
